<p>
As a dedicated front-end and back-end developer, I specialize in crafting dynamic and responsive web applications that deliver seamless user experiences. With expertise in <b>ReactJS</b>, JavaScript, and <b>Redux-Toolkit</b>, I bring modern interfaces to life. My front-end skills extend to styling with <b>HTML5</b>, <b>CSS3</b>, and frameworks like <b>TailwindCSS</b>, <b>Material-UI</b>.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
On the back-end, I am proficient in <b>Node.js</b> and <b>Express</b>, building robust server-side applications that integrate seamlessly with <b>MongoDB</b> for efficient database management. My hands-on experience with <b>Firebase</b> further enhances my ability to manage and scale databases across both front-end and back-end environments.
</p>
<br/>
<p>I am also skilled in API testing using <b>Postman</b>, ensuring that the applications I develop are reliable and secure. My passion for staying up-to-date with industry trends keeps me excited about delivering cutting-edge solutions.</p>
<br/>
<p>I look forward to contributing my full-stack expertise, creativity, and problem-solving skills to exciting projects, continuously pushing the boundaries of web development.</p>
